This section contains manuscript scores of works from the Spanish classical repertoire arranged by Barbara Solís, most for piano with viola.

Ms. Solís conceived of her duo arrangements as two parts that were complementary, with neither instrument taking a consistently solo role. She was particularly interested in exploring the viola’s capacity for musical colour to express the various moods of her chosen repertoire.

Although most of Ms. Solís’s arrangements are for piano with viola, she also arranged a few pieces for solo viola to accompany a dancer who plays finger cymbals or tambourine. She arranged two works for two pianos (Albeniz’s Granada and Rapsodia Cubana) and another work for two pianos with soprano and viola (Falla’s El Amor Brujo).
