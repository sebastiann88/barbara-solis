[Barbara Solís](https://skylightdesigns.ca/ "Barbara Solis") presented recitals in Spain in the 1970s, several of them for dignitaries. Her papers contain no concert programs from this period.

The concert materials listed below are almost all from programs Ms. Solís presented in Ottawa, Canada. Of particular interest in these materials are her program notes, which convey Ms. Solís’s written and spoken thoughts on the themes she presented in her concerts.

Ms. Solís always performed in Spanish dress for her recitals in Ottawa, and she encouraged her performance partners to do the same. Red was a recurring colour in her concert attire, and she often decorated the stage with floral arrangements. The red carnation, the national flower of Spain, also figured prominently.
