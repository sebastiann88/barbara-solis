      <description>Barbara Solís presented recitals in Spain in the 1970s, several of them for dignitaries. Her papers contain no concert programs from this period.&#xA;The concert materials listed below are almost all from programs Ms. Solís presented in Ottawa, Canada. Of particular interest in these materials are her program notes, which convey Ms. Solís’s written and spoken thoughts on the themes she presented in her concerts.&#xA;Ms. Solís always performed in Spanish dress for her recitals in Ottawa, and she encouraged her performance partners to do the same.</description>

      <description>Good evening, all. It is a sad occasion for us to be here, of course, but I would like to thank the Solís family for having this memorial service here, and for bringing us together today to remember Barbara in all the ways that she influenced us, in some ways subtly and in other ways profoundly.&#xA;My relationship with Barbara was sometimes straightforward, and sometimes it presented complexities. But it was always enormously rewarding, and I trust that it was mutually so.</description>

      <description>For a period, Barbara Solís lived in at least one small community in Canada’s western region, in the province of Alberta. She taught piano during these years and in her later years as well.&#xA;In her undated manuscript “The Barbara Solís Method of Teaching,” Ms. Solís aimed to provide a method of musical instruction that would provide students with a foundation they could benefit from when a music teacher was not available in a small community.</description>

      <description>This section contains manuscript scores of works from the Spanish classical repertoire arranged by Barbara Solís, most for piano with viola.&#xA;Ms. Solís conceived of her duo arrangements as two parts that were complementary, with neither instrument taking a consistently solo role. She was particularly interested in exploring the viola’s capacity for musical colour to express the various moods of her chosen repertoire.&#xA;Although most of Ms. Solís’s arrangements are for piano with viola, she also arranged a few pieces for solo viola to accompany a dancer who plays finger cymbals or tambourine.</description>
