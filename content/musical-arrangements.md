This section contains manuscript scores of works from the Spanish classical repertoire arranged by Barbara Solís, most for piano with viola. 

Ms. Solís conceived of her duo arrangements as two parts that were complementary, with neither instrument taking a consistently solo role. She was particularly interested in exploring the viola’s capacity for musical colour to express the various moods of her chosen repertoire.

Although most of Ms. Solís’s arrangements are for piano with viola, she also arranged a few pieces for solo viola to accompany a dancer who plays finger cymbals or tambourine. She arranged two works for two pianos (Albeniz’s Granada and Rapsodia Cubana) and another work for two pianos with soprano and viola (Falla’s El Amor Brujo).

Starting in the 1990s, Ms. Solís studied music arranging with composer [Steven Gellman](https://www.stevengellman.com/ "Steven Gellman") at the University of Ottawa. Their association was uniquely productive and collaborative, with Professor Gellman and his wife, Cheryl Gellman, a professional visual artist, providing tangible support to several of Ms. Solís’s concert presentations in Ottawa.

Many of the files listed below reproduce the manuscript scores that Barbara Solís used in concert. Ms. Solís wrote her arrangements in pencil, and they remain legible, accurate and usable for performance.

Seven of Ms. Solís’s arrangements for piano with viola listed below (indicated by \*) can be heard on the CD [The Mystical Music of Andalucia](/andalucia "The Mystical Music of Andalucia").
