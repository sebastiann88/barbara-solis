For a period, Barbara Solís lived in at least one small community in Canada’s western region, in the province of Alberta. She taught piano during these years and in her later years as well.

In her undated manuscript “The Barbara Solís Method of Teaching,” Ms. Solís aimed to provide a method of musical instruction that would provide students with a foundation they could benefit from when a music teacher was not available in a small community. Ms. Solís referred to her teaching method in her artist biography in the 1988–89 edition of Alberta Performing Artists.

Ms. Solís had an indirect connection with another piano teacher in western Canada. This connection was Lyell Gustin (1895–1988), who in 1920 began what would become a celebrated piano teaching studio in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
