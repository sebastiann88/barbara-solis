Barbara Solís undertook Bachelor of Music studies at the University of Ottawa, graduating in 1996. During this time, she also studied aspects of Arabic culture.

Most of the files listed below link to Ms. Solís’s academic papers written during this period.

Some of Ms. Solís’s academic papers include her decorations in ink inspired by her time in Spain in the 1970s. In one of her papers (1990 - La Musica Espanol del Sigio XIX), she explained that her “artwork has… been extracted from the memories I hold from studying countless balconies, cathedrals and anything which pertained to 19th century Spain. It therefore is not meaningless scribble but has significance.”

Examples of Ms. Solís’s decorations in ink appear throughout this website.
